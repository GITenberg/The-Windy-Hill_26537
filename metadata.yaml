description: Visiting their uncle one summer, Oliver and Janet Peyton become more
  and more puzzled by the behavior of the hostile Anthony Crawford, another cousin
  of whom they had never heard. Who is this unpleasant man, and what strange hold
  does he have over Cousin Jasper? Could the answer lie in the Beeman's stories about
  the history of the valley, and their family?
